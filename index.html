            scientific programming and computations.</p>

                <p>The aim of this project was to develop an easy-to-build and deploy educational robot, which may be
                    used during classes to study machine vision-based control and classification. This was achieved by a
                    double scara structure driven by two stepper motors controlled by RaspberryPI Zero. Exercises may
                    include inverse kinematics, control and positioning, data collection, and image classification.</p>

                <p>Proposed method of failure detection in toothed gears is based on the reconstruction of gear case
                    vibrational signal. Its effectiveness was tested in an experiment on a power circulation test stand.
                    The method offers high efficiency (0.95 F1-measure) in gear state prediction (100% in failure
                    detection, 89.8% in normal state prediction) and high sensitivity while it can detect even slight
                    surface damage (initial pitting).</p>

                    system for automatic inspection of small objects – copper seals for fuel and gas installations. In
                    the
                    designed automatic control system machine vision was used among others to evaluate the roundness of
                    manufactured sealings and their prefabricated material. </p>

                <p>This project comes with my cooperation with one of the world's leading manufacturers of aerospace
                    gears. The goal was to develop a method for effective error-free design of honing tools for airspace
                    gears. I came up with the mathematical model of the gear honing process based on which the method of
                    prediction of profile errors was established and used within the design flow of honing tools.</p>

                <p>This work is part of a larger international project related to the influence of gear accuracy on
                    vibration and noise excitation. My job was to determine what is the influence of gear surface
                    deviations on transmission error and the resulting vibration of the gearbox. For that purpose, I
                    developed a mathematical model that enables to comparison transmission error spectrum with the
                    spectrum of the actual gear case acceleration signal and evaluate its components and the influence
                    on the gearbox's operation.</p>

                <p>This project results from my interest in math. What is the largest area of region that can be moved
                    through a ninety-degree corner in a hallway of unit width? - this problem called "the moving sofa
                    problem" was formulated for the first time by Moser and till now has not been solved fully. Here I
                    present my implementation of the method for obtaining the shape and area of the sofa. The proposed
                    approach is based on discrete solving the equations, which state the necessary conditions of
                    envelope existence. </p>
